# Conference Website
This website was designed by me for the __International Conference on Real and Applied Mathematics '18__
hosted by the Department of Mathematics at the Delhi Technological University.
 
## Why is this simple? Where is the cool Stuff?
The project is a simple single page static application. Payment and other features were also added including
a backend server but that repository also contains private Database keys hence has been kept private
and this repository is only here to display the styling and design prowess :D

## Running the App
Simply open index.html using your mouse or downloaded `node-server` and voila!
